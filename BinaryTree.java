/*
 * Class BinaryTree
 *
 * This class defines a binary tree object; it is a tree structure where every
 * node as at most two child nodes, which form the tree branches. That implies
 * that each node within the tree has a degree of 0, 1, or 2. A node of degree
 * zero (0) is called a terminal node, or leaf node.
 *
 * Each non-leaf node is often called a branch node, which will have  either one or
 * two children (a left and right child node). There is no order guarantee within
 * this basic binary tree object. Given that this binary object is NOT a Binary Search Tree (BST), there is
 * no guarantee on order in the tree.
 *
 * As just stated, the insert method does NOT guarantee the order within the tree, but
 * its logic attempts to follow the rules of BSTs -- meaning the insert method will traverse
 * the binary tree searching for a location to insert the new Node using traversal
 * logic similar to BSTs. But again, this is not a BST, so there is no guarantee that
 * the tree's order maintains that defined by a BST.
 *
 * Public methods:
 *  void deleteTree()      - deletes the tree.
 *  Node insert(int data)  - inserts a new node into the tree containing value 'data'.
 *  String preOrder()      - return the tree in 'preorder' traversal in a String object.
 *
 * The following methods you will complete:
 *  void replaceValue(int k, int l) - if data value 'k' is in tree, replace with data
 *                           value 'l'; for simplicity at the moment, do not re-organize
 *                           the tree based on new value which means this operation may
 *                           violate the binary tree definition.
 *  int findMin()          - returns the small data value stored in the tree.
 *  int nodesGT(int val)   - return the number of nodes in the tree that have a data value
 *                           greater than 'val'.
 *  double average()       - return the average data value of all data values stored in
 *                           the tree.

     * tree.

     * The property basically implies that for every node in the tree:
     *   1) every node in the tree has 2 children, except for possibly the last level.
     *   2) and on the last level, all nodes are as far left as possible.

     * There are no order properties of a basic binary tree.

     * This method uses a breath first search of the binary tree to locate the
     * location of where to insert the new node. This approach basically starts at
     * the root, and searches level by level until the next free spot for the insertion.
     * This approach maintains the 'complete tree' property of the binary tree.
